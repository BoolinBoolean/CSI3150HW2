        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>In my free time I like to do a few things. 
            I really like playing video games, the genre’s I spend most of my time playing are Tactical shooters (Counter-Strike & Valorant) and all types of rpg’s (mmo, single player, fantasy, historical fiction, etc.). 
            aside from video games I go to the movies every week with friends. A big series we follow are the MCU movies but we’re bigger fans of DC and I personally like the occasional artsy film from time to time like The Green Knight. 
            Finally I like reading books, I am currently reading a history of the crusades so I can settle an argument I’m having with a friend of mine.</p>
